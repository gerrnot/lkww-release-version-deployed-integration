# JSON Schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-ai/release-api/main/synthetic-type-definitions/type-definition-schema.json
#
# Yaml-based format to define types in Release, as an alternative to type-definitions.xml
# This format is in Tech Preview in Release 23.3 and may change in future versions.
#
# You can also use type-definitions.xml to define types. Note that contents of the two files
# are merged. This means that you can't have the same type definition in both
# type-definitions.yaml and type-definitions.xml at the same time.

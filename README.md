Dai release go sdk based plugin to get the currently deployed release (helm chart and helm release) version
(via lkww [portal](http://lkwbitbucket.lkw-walter.com/projects/MM/repos/portal/browse)).

the dai release go template - more information on how the base code for this repo was obtained
and how to work on this project in general can be found in the file
